Day 8 ~ Code Societies ~ Winter 2019

Much of the technology we encounter in our daily lives takes the form of a service, and of servitude. Our desires are taken as a given, and technology attempts for fulfillment. 

What is technology that debates and disputes, rather than fulfills our desires?  What is intimate software, created by us, only for us, that debates with our ethical selves?

On Day 8 of Code Societies, we were joined by Dan Taeyoung. Dan is a technologist, architect, and community designer interested in the ways we collectively create communities, and how experimental tools and environments change the ways we think, collaborate, and learn with one another.

Our first thinking prompt was to consider whether it is possible to create technology that does not serve us but is concerned for us, cares for us - care will be more broadly conceptualized later on. Many of the technologies that mediate our experiences of the everyday occupy positions of servitude and replace human labor in one form or another: the self-checkout line, online appointment software, banking apps, translation software, and this list goes infinitely on. Dan specifically cited the example of [Google Duplex](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18123785/google-duplex-how-to-use-reservations), Google's uncannily human sounding AI technology that can now schedule your appointments. Do these services exist already (of course)? Could you hire someone to help you do these tasks instead (of course)? 

There are all kinds of ethical considerations that fall to the wayside when considering a piece of technology like Google Duplex, but one of the most charged is the matter of consent. In calling your barber to book an appointment, both you and your barber implicitly consent to the interaction either by calling or picking up the phone. You agree on 3 pm next Monday and perhaps you ask one another about jobs, family, life. In a reality where your barber uses Google Duplex to subsume the role of appointment booking, there is no room for your consent, no opportunity for you to reject this interaction. Perhaps you mistake the scheduling service for an actual person and you try to make small talk - what would Google say back to you?

The English word robot comes from the Czech *robota* meaning forced labor or compulsory service. Dan challenged us to consider whether there are technologies that cannot be replaced by human labor. 

What is human effort that doesn’t serve us?
When have you last done something, and your efforts didn’t serve others, and was not asking for others to serve you, was not increasing your productivity?

Effort that does not serve others is care. Care can take many different forms(encouragement, acts of care, spending time together, human touch, advice, empathy, concern, honest observation, critique, arguing)

what kind of vocabularies can we use to describe the care that we show for others or ourselves, that are not based on labor?

How can technologies be used as a form of care for self or others, care being a relationship that exists outside a labor or power relationship?


Dan believes that is looks different wherever it goes


What is human effort that doesn't serve us?
- care for others, concern for others
- effort VS labor
    - encouragement
    - acts of care
    - spending time together
    - human touch
    - advice
    - empathy
    - concern
    - observation
    - critique
    - arguing
    - what does care for others look like for you?

Critcal (re)examination of care

Are there technologies that hold our concerns and give us honest observation and critique? Technologies that help us access deeper parts of 

Eliza was one of the first chatbots created in ____ give Eliza history ___
- takes the form of a psychotherapist that speaks back to you
- first chatbot
- one of the earliest examples of natural language processing

There are multiple iterations of [Eliza]() hosted across the web - you could talk to her if you wanted to. Does it bother you that I'm gendering Eliza in this blog post?
