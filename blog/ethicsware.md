# Ethicsware
Day 8 ~ Code Societies ~ Winter 2019

Much of the technology we encounter in our daily lives takes the form of a service, and of servitude. Our desires are taken as a given, and technology attempts for fulfillment. 

What is technology that debates and disputes, rather than fulfills our desires?  What is intimate software, created by us, only for us, that debates with our ethical selves? 

In this session, let's experiment together with creating ethicsware: software in dialogue with our ethical selves. Using checklists and chatbots as a starting point, we’ll code with Python and use messaging APIs to create ethicsware experiments. We'll talk about ELIZA, a psychotherapist chatbot created in 1966, the influence of classist labor practices onto technology, and the ethics of emotional labor.

What does it mean to create technology that operates on our ethics? What is technology that does not serve us, but is concerned for us? Technologies of care and concern, over service and fulfillment? Let’s find out together!

On Day 8 of Code Societies we were joined by Dan Taeyoung. Dan is a technologist, architect, and community designer interested in ways in which we can collectively create communities, and how experimental tools and environments change the way we think, collaborate, and learn with one other.
