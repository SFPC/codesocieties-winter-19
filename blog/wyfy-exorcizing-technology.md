_Whose world is this? The World is Ours. Together students will work thru a Beta version of BUFUs latest experimental model on organizing WYFY - a project seeking to invite us to rethinking how we build space online// IRL for our most equitable future. We will also participate in various meditative exercises to exorcize technology._


On Day 6 we were joined by Tsige Tafesse and Katherine Tom of By Us For Us (BUFU), for a knowledge share on how to critically (re)engage the ways that we establish and inhabit spaces online and IRL. We started by reading BUFU's Community Guidelines and sharing how certain codes of conduct landed with us before talking about the history of BUFU.

Since the collective's inception in September of 2015, institutions have been trying to define BUFU and render them legible. Are they an art collective? Are they a technology collaborative? Do they throw parties too? Why did someone give them a warehouse? BUFU has never identified themselves as an art collective, a technology collaborative, or whatever - but it is a long-standing tradition for the press, media, art and academic institutions to read whatever they want from queer, femme and non-binary, Black and Asian bodies rather than let them define themselves.

From their [site](http://www.bufubyusforus.com/):

"BUFU IS A COLLABORATIVE LIVING ARCHIVE CENTERED AROUND (PAN)BLACK AND (PAN)ASIAN CULTURAL AND POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS. WE, THE FOUNDERS OF THIS PROJECT, ARE A COLLECTIVE OF QUEER, FEMME AND NON-BINARY, BLACK AND EAST-ASIAN ARTISTS AND ORGANIZERS. OUR GOAL IS TO FACILITATE A GLOBAL CONVERSATION ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLACK AND ASIAN DIASPORAS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BUILDING SOLIDARITY, DE-CENTERING WHITENESS, AND RESURFACING OUR DEEPLY INTERCONNECTED AND COMPLICATED HISTORIES. WE ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE THIS THROUGH OUR COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMMING, OUR VISUAL ARCHIVES, AND THROUGH BUILDING LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS WITH COLLECTIVES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS."

The members of BUFU came together during their time at an institution that remained unnamed, irrelevant. Following a screening of *Mountains That Take Wing-Angela Davis & Yuri Kochiyama: A Conversation on Life, Struggles & Liberation*, they struggled to find a language through which to talk about Black and Asian solidarity and all the tensions and nuances surrounding what that can or should look like. From this tension came a documentary project on Black and Asian diasporas that has taken them to Japan, Jamaica, Korea, China, Ethiopia, and across the United States. They were very generous to share with us a cut from their forthcoming documentary that they will take on.

and an entire grassroots organizing movement through which they've hosted events across all 5 boroughs of New York. 

BUFU has used their illegibility as a tool garner access to and resources from institutions around the world. Since 2013 BUFU has moved through many models of organizing, from their first warehouse space in Clinton Hill to their

Tsige mentioned that for her, on some level, organizing is a selfish endeavor - an attempt to build a version of the future that is more conducive for her survival and the survival of those she loves. This really landed with me.

Our first activity following this conversation was to write, either whatever was settling in a particular way after our conversation or this prompt if we needed it: How are you coming into a relationship with technology? What are some of the times you have experienced a beautiful connection due to online space? What are some times when you felt a block, anxiety or challenge in connection with online space?

After writing we were asked to spend some time on our phones with an observer taking notice of how our body dymanics changed or did not change. The observer noticed that I slouch in the same way regardless of whether I'm writing or on my phone - which I guess is a cue that I have trash posture - and that everyone seemed to be craddling their phones like tiny phone babies. Other folks in the room reported feeling like a troll hunched over their device or a narrowing of their peripheral vision, with the rest of the world filtered out, all that was left was their phone. 

What about you reader? Stop and notice how you're feeling as you read this. Is there tension in your face? Are your eyes straining? Is your body comfortable in whatever position it's in?

In our final activity, Kat and Tsige challenged us to come up with three Codes of Conducts in pairs, then to link up with another pair and widdle our 6 CoCs into 3, then to link up with another group of 4 and so on until we were divided up into two large groups with 3 CoCs each.
