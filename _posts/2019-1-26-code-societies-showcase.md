On the final day of Code Societies, we celebrated each other and the experience as a whole with a showcase event. Each student gave a short presentation on something they had been working on or thinking about since participating in the program. The impact of the program on each student really came through It was so nice to hear everyone's reflections on the experience. It became clear just how meaningful the workshops had been for each person. In addition to giving short presentations we also had the opportunity to install our work in the window room of SFPC. Between mushrooms and pen plotters and sad google queries I would say the show was a success! It was so fun to finally spend some time with all of the different projects. Even though we only had a day and a half to get everything ready for a public viewing I was able to see all of the things we discussed throughout the 3 week session shining through each piece.

###### AC Gillette:	_Found Manuscripts I II and III_
These mid 22nd century manuscripts were found at an abandoned CYM site. On loan from The Society for the Study of the CYM People.

###### Carlos Sanchez	_Artist Website as Shifting Landscape/Character_
Work-in-progress collaboration with movement-theater artist and poet, Jo Stewart. This project begins with a metaphor extracted from the artist’s practice that is taken as the site’s architectural backbone.

###### Deni Chen:	_God View_
God View takes from statements Big Tech companies have made in response to public outrage to examine how language is used in the industry to obfuscate wrongdoing and evade accountability. The poem is created using predictive text generation, learning from and remixing a corpus of real public apologies by CEOs across various companies along with Jeff Bezos’ speech, ‘Amazing Amazon Story,’ which details Amazon’s incredible start-up journey.

###### Emily Saltz:	_Super Sad Googles_
[Super Sad Googles](http://super-sad-googles.glitch.me) is an autocomplete search platform populated only with users' saddest, weirdest, most disturbed searches. The goal of searching Super Sad Googles is not to find an answer, but to find (advertisement-free!) solace in the queries of fellow weirdos.

###### Jarret Bryan: _git-commitment_
[git commitment](https://git-commitment.hashbase.io) is a data-visualization that unsuccessfully quantifies the contributions you make not to code repositories, but to your relationships.
!["A photograph of Jarret's git commitment page on a laptop screen. It reads: emotive web. on GitHub, your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you’ve made to git repositories - commits, pull requests, code reviews, issue reporting, etc. contributions are only counted if they meet certain criteria. among these criteria is not the significance of your contribution, just that it happened. a pull request for a crucial bug fix holds the same weight as a pull request as a cosmetic typo. git commitment unsuccessfully quantifies the contributions you make not to code repositories but to your relationships. acts of care, emotional investment, expressions of compassion, empathy, and intimacy - your commitment - can only be counted in discrete increments. git commitment unsuccessfully quantifies the contributions you make not to code repositories but to you relationships. acts, emotional investment, expressions of compassion, empathy, and intimacy - your -commitment - can only be counted in discrete increments. git commitment cannot weigh the significance of any ‘contribution’ to you relationships - only they happened. something like saying i love you might just be one contribution - whether it was a heartfelt full-throated expression of genuine love, or an automated response to signal the end of a phone call. are you performing as part of an automated process, or genuinely emoting? what qualifies as a ‘contribution’ to your relationships is something that can resist computation or quantification. moreover the results are self reported. git commitment therefore is not just a measure of relationships, or a journal, but a report of self-worth or self-importance. it may rely on the idea of the relationship as something transactional, in which you need to offer something consistently. it may not. you can make your own commitment heat map: using beaker, GitHub or the dat cli tool - fork this repository. you can edit the ‘dates.csv’ int he repository, suing excel, numbers or any text editor, the count will represent the number of…"]({{ "/assets/jarret-1.jpg" | relative_url }})

###### Mimi Doan: _Autonomous Missed Connections_
An experiment in (re)generative/recycled computational longing.

From automatic writing through automation to creating a distributed web of care, we covered a [vast amount of material](https://github.com/SFPC/codesocieties-winter-19) over the course of a mere 3 weeks. With countless new ideas and seedings of nurturing friendships, the depth we achieved in this short window of time served as testament to the boundless possibilities that lay ahead. I'm excited to see how our relationships develop and what will come of the final assignment Melanie set us -- to take the Code Societies syllabus and spirit, and adapt it to our own communities with hopes that hybrid futures will emerge.
