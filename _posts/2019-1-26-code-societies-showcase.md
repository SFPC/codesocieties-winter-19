On the final day of code societies we celebrated each other and the experience as a whole with a showcase event. Each student gave a short presentation on something they had been working on or thinking about since participating in code societies. It was so nice to hear everyone's reflections on the experience. It became clear just how meaningful the workshops had been for each person. In addition to giving short presentations we also had the opportunity to install our work in the window room of SFPC. Between mushrooms and pen plotters and sad google queries I would say the show was a success ! It was so fun to finally spend some time with all of the different projects. Even though we only had a day and a half to get everything ready for a public viewing I was able to see all of the things we discussed throughout the 3 week session shining through each piece.
